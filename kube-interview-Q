1. Why kubernetes?

-> docker is a single host where one container will be affected by other
-> There is no auto-healing in docker. if a container goes down, user should manulally track and bring them up.
-> there is no auto-scaling in docker.
-> docker does not support enterprise level standards like LB, firewall, autoscale, heal, apigateway.
